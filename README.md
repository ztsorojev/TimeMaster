# TimeMaster
**A web app to manage your to do lists.**

**Video demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDVuontuZ8Y

The web app was built using Bootstrap and JavaScript.
I used Webpack and Babel to compile JavaScript ES6 and SCSS.

## How to run the web app

The compiled code is in the **dist** folder, but you need a server to run it.

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer so you can use npm.

Then, in the directory of the project, run the following commands in a terminal:
```
npm install
npm run start
```

This will run a local server on your computer.
A new webpage with the url `localhost:8080` should open and display the website.
